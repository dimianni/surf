# A landing page for a surfcamp

This was my first website build with a task runner, in this case it is [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/). This configuration is quite outdated now (26 May 2021) and it uses old syntax. [Here](https://github.com/dimianni/gulp_config) is my new version of Gulp configuration. And [here](https://github.com/dimianni/my-webpack-configuration) is my even newer webpack configuration.

What I really like about this website is it's design and animations that I have managed to create with [wow.js](https://wowjs.uk/) and [animate.css](https://animate.style/). [Check it out!](https://dimianni.github.io/surf/) 

## To clone the repo, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dimianni/surf.git
```

## Installation

First, make sure you have installed [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) globally on computer.

Then, install [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start) globally with this command:

```bash
   npm i --global gulp-cli
```

After having installed Node and Gulp, and cloning the repo, run the following command in the folder's terminal:

```bash
  npm i 
```

## Usage

There are only two commands.

This will start a development server:
```bash
gulp start
```

This will create a production build:
```bash
gulp build
```
